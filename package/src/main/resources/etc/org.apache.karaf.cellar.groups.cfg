# The following properties define the behavior to use when the node joins the cluster (the usage of the bootstrap
#Â synchronizer), per cluster group and per resource.
# The following values are accepted:
# disabled: means that the synchronizer is not used, meaning the node or the cluster are not updated at all
# cluster: if the node is the first one in the cluster, it pushes its local state to the cluster, else it's not the
#       first node of the cluster, the node will update its local state with the cluster one (meaning that the cluster
#       is the master)
# node: in this case, the node is the master, it means that the cluster state will be overwritten by the node state.
