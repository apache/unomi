# Unomi REST Authentication Configuration
# This file configures authentication settings for Unomi REST endpoints

# V2 Compatibility Mode
# When enabled, allows V2 clients to use Unomi V3 without requiring API keys
# - Public endpoints (like /context.json) require no authentication (like V2)
# - Private endpoints require system administrator authentication (like V2)
# - A default tenant is automatically used for all operations
v2CompatibilityModeEnabled = ${org.apache.unomi.rest.authentication.v2CompatibilityModeEnabled:-false}

# V2 Compatibility Default Tenant ID
# Default tenant ID to use in V2 compatibility mode
# This tenant will be used for all operations when V2 compatibility mode is enabled
# Should match the tenant ID used during migration (e.g., "default" or "system")
v2CompatibilityDefaultTenantId = ${org.apache.unomi.rest.authentication.v2CompatibilityDefaultTenantId:-default}
