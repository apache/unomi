=== Useful Apache Unomi URLs

In this section we will list some useful URLs that can be used to quickly access parts of Apache Unomi that can help
you understand or diagnose what is going on in the system.

You can of course find more information about the REST API in the http://unomi.apache.org/documentation.html[related section]
in the Apache Unomi website.

For these requests it can be nice to use a browser (such as Firefox) that understands JSON to make it easier to view the
results as the returned JSON is not beautified (another possiblity is a tool such as Postman).

Important : all URLs are relative to the private Apache Unomi URL, by default: https://localhost:9443

section in the REST API] for details.

|/cxs/events/search
|POST
|Listing events for a profile. You will need to provide a query in the body of the request that looks something like this (and https://unomi.apache.org/rest-api-doc/#1768188821[documentation is available in the REST API]) :
{ "offset" : 0,
  "limit" : 20,
  "condition" : {
    "type": "eventPropertyCondition",
    "parameterValues" : {
      "propertyName" : "profileId",
      "comparisonOperator" : "equals",
      "propertyValue" : "PROFILE_ID"
    }
  }
}
where PROFILE_ID is a profile identifier. This will indeed retrieve all the events for a given profile.
