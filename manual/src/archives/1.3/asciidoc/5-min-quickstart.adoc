==== Five Minutes QuickStart

1) Install JDK 8 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and make sure you set the
JAVA_HOME variable https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/

2) Download ElasticSearch here : https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-5-6-3 (please <strong>make sure</strong> you use the proper version : 5.6.3)

3) Uncompress it and change the `config/elasticsearch.yml` to include the following config : <code>cluster.name: contextElasticSearch</code>

4) Launch ElasticSearch using : `bin/elasticsearch`

5) Download Apache Unomi here : http://unomi.incubator.apache.org/download.html

6) Start it using : `./bin/karaf`

7) Start the Apache Unomi packages using `unomi:start` in the Apache Karaf Shell

8) Wait for startup to complete

9) Try accessing https://localhost:9443/cxs/cluster with username/password: `karaf/karaf` . You might get a certificate warning in your browser, just accept it despite the warning it is safe.

10) Request your first context by simply accessing : http://localhost:8181/cxs/context.js?sessionId=1234

11) If something goes wrong, you should check the logs in `./data/log/karaf.log`. If you get errors on ElasticSearch,
make sure you are using the proper version.
