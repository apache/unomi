==== Migration Overview

Apache Unomi 3.0 is a major release that introduces several breaking changes. This document details the steps required to successfully migrate your environment from Apache Unomi 2.x to Apache Unomi 3.0.

==== Prerequisites

Before migrating to Apache Unomi 3.0, ensure you meet the following requirements:

===== Java Version Requirements

Apache Unomi 3.0 requires **Java 17 or later**. This is a breaking change from previous versions that supported Java 11.

- **Minimum Java Version**: Java 17
- **Recommended**: Java 17 LTS
- **Tested Versions**: Java 17 (most tested), Java 21

===== Search Engine Compatibility

Apache Unomi 3.0 supports the following search engine versions:

- **Elasticsearch**: Version 9.x (upgraded from 7.17.5)
- **OpenSearch**: Version 3.x (new support)

===== Karaf Version Upgrade

Apache Unomi 3.0 includes an upgrade of the underlying Karaf framework:

- **Previous Version**: Karaf 4.2.15
- **New Version**: Karaf 4.4.8

This upgrade brings improved stability and support for the latest dependencies.

==== Elasticsearch Client Upgrade

Apache Unomi 3.0 includes a major upgrade to the Elasticsearch client:

- **Previous**: REST client (deprecated and no longer supported)
- **New**: Official Elasticsearch Java client

This change provides:
- Better performance and reliability
- Full compatibility with Elasticsearch 9.x
- Improved error handling and connection management
- Future-proof client that follows Elasticsearch's official client roadmap

The new client is automatically used when connecting to Elasticsearch - no configuration changes are required.

==== QueryBuilder ID Changes

In Apache Unomi 3.0, all queryBuilder IDs have been renamed to remove ElasticSearch-specific references and make them more generic. This change affects custom condition definitions that reference built-in query builders.

===== Impact on Custom Condition Definitions

If you have custom condition definitions that reference built-in query builders using the `queryBuilderId` parameter, you will need to update these references to use the new queryBuilder IDs.

===== QueryBuilder ID Mapping Table

The following table shows the mapping between old and new queryBuilder IDs:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Condition Type |Old QueryBuilder ID |New QueryBuilder ID

|IDs Condition
|`idsConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`idsConditionQueryBuilder`

|Geo Location by Point Session Condition
|`geoLocationByPointSessionConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`geoLocationByPointSessionConditionQueryBuilder`

|Past Event Condition
|`pastEventConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`pastEventConditionQueryBuilder`

|Boolean Condition
|`booleanConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`booleanConditionQueryBuilder`

|Not Condition
|`notConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`notConditionQueryBuilder`

|Match All Condition
|`matchAllConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`matchAllConditionQueryBuilder`

|Property Condition
|`propertyConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`propertyConditionQueryBuilder`

|Source Event Property Condition
|`sourceEventPropertyConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`sourceEventPropertyConditionQueryBuilder`

|Nested Condition
|`nestedConditionESQueryBuilder`
|`nestedConditionQueryBuilder`
|===

===== Migration Steps

1. **Identify Custom Condition Definitions**: Review your custom condition definitions to find any that reference the old queryBuilder IDs listed in the table above.

2. **Update QueryBuilder References**: Replace the old queryBuilder IDs with the new ones according to the mapping table.

3. **Test Your Conditions**: After updating the references, test your custom conditions to ensure they continue to work as expected.

===== Example Migration

**Before (Apache Unomi 2.x):**
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "customIdsCondition",
  "name": "Custom IDs Condition",
  "conditionType": "idsCondition",
  "queryBuilderId": "idsConditionESQueryBuilder",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "id": "ids",
      "type": "string",
      "multivalued": true
    }
  ]
}
----

**After (Apache Unomi 3.0):**
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "customIdsCondition",
  "name": "Custom IDs Condition",
  "conditionType": "idsCondition",
  "queryBuilderId": "idsConditionQueryBuilder",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "id": "ids",
      "type": "string",
      "multivalued": true
    }
  ]
}
----

===== Important Notes

- This change affects both ElasticSearch and OpenSearch persistence implementations
- The functionality of the query builders remains unchanged; only the IDs have been renamed
- Built-in condition definitions provided by Apache Unomi have been automatically updated
- If you are using only built-in conditions without custom queryBuilder references, no migration is required

===== Backward Compatibility

Apache Unomi 3.0 includes a configurable mapping system that provides backward compatibility for legacy queryBuilder IDs. This means that existing custom condition definitions using the old queryBuilder IDs will continue to work without modification.

The mapping system automatically translates legacy queryBuilder IDs to their new equivalents:

- **Automatic Translation**: Legacy IDs are automatically mapped to new IDs at runtime
- **Optimized Performance**: New queryBuilder IDs are checked first, legacy mapping lookup only occurs when needed
- **Warning System**: Legacy ID usage triggers warning logs with specific condition type information
- **Deprecation Notices**: Clear warnings indicate that legacy mappings are deprecated

**Built-in Mappings:**
The legacy mappings for built-in queryBuilder IDs are provided as hardcoded defaults in the dispatcher implementations (for both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch). These defaults cannot be modified at runtime:

- `idsConditionESQueryBuilder` → `idsConditionQueryBuilder`
- `geoLocationByPointSessionConditionESQueryBuilder` → `geoLocationByPointSessionConditionQueryBuilder`
- `pastEventConditionESQueryBuilder` → `pastEventConditionQueryBuilder`
- `booleanConditionESQueryBuilder` → `booleanConditionQueryBuilder`
- `notConditionESQueryBuilder` → `notConditionQueryBuilder`
- `matchAllConditionESQueryBuilder` → `matchAllConditionQueryBuilder`
- `propertyConditionESQueryBuilder` → `propertyConditionQueryBuilder`
- `sourceEventPropertyConditionESQueryBuilder` → `sourceEventPropertyConditionQueryBuilder`
- `nestedConditionESQueryBuilder` → `nestedConditionQueryBuilder`

For custom query builder implementations, migrate to the new naming convention and provide both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch implementations as documented in the plugin guide.

**IMPORTANT WARNING FOR PLUGIN DEVELOPERS:**

If you have custom query builder implementations, you should **NOT** rely on legacy mappings for your custom query builders. Instead, you should:

1. **Rename your custom query builders** to follow the new naming convention (remove "ES" references, use generic "QueryBuilder" suffix)

2. **Provide separate implementations** for Elasticsearch and OpenSearch:
   - Create separate bundles for Elasticsearch (`ConditionESQueryBuilder`) and OpenSearch (`ConditionOSQueryBuilder`) implementations
   - Use separate Karaf features for each implementation
   - Configure the appropriate feature in your start configuration based on the selected search engine

3. **Update your condition type definitions** to use the new query builder IDs

4. **Use proper OSGi service registration** to ensure your query builders are only active when the corresponding search engine is in use

This approach ensures:
- **Better maintainability**: No dependency on legacy mapping system
- **Search engine compatibility**: Proper support for both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch
- **Cleaner architecture**: Separate concerns for different search engines
- **Future-proof**: No risk of legacy mapping removal affecting your plugins

**Warning System:**
When legacy queryBuilder IDs are used, Apache Unomi will log warning messages that include:
- The legacy queryBuilder ID being used
- The specific condition type that needs to be updated
- The new queryBuilder ID that should be used
- A deprecation notice indicating that legacy mappings may be removed in future versions

**Example Warning Log:**
[source]
----
WARN - DEPRECATED: Using legacy queryBuilderId 'idsConditionESQueryBuilder' for condition type 'customIdsCondition'. 
Please update your condition definition to use the new queryBuilderId 'idsConditionQueryBuilder'. 
Legacy mappings are deprecated and may be removed in future versions.
----

**Migration Strategy:**
While the mapping system provides backward compatibility, it is recommended to update your custom condition definitions to use the new queryBuilder IDs for better maintainability and to prepare for future versions where legacy support may be removed. The warning system will help you identify which condition definitions need to be updated.

==== Configuration Changes

===== OpenSearch Security Configuration

When using OpenSearch 3.x with Apache Unomi 3.0, security is enabled by default and requires specific configuration:

[source,properties]
----
# OpenSearch security settings (required by default since OpenSearch 3)
org.apache.unomi.opensearch.ssl.enable=true
org.apache.unomi.opensearch.username=admin
org.apache.unomi.opensearch.password=${env:OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}
org.apache.unomi.opensearch.sslTrustAllCertificates=true
----

**Important Notes:**
- Security is enabled by default in OpenSearch 3.x
- The default admin username is 'admin'
- The initial admin password can be set via `OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable
- SSL/TLS is required for OpenSearch connections

===== Docker Configuration Changes

When using Docker, you can specify the search engine backend:

- **For Elasticsearch**: `UNOMI_AUTO_START=elasticsearch`
- **For OpenSearch**: `UNOMI_AUTO_START=opensearch`
- **For custom configurations**: `UNOMI_AUTO_START=your-custom-config-name`

==== Migrating from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch

Apache Unomi 3.0 introduces official support for OpenSearch as an alternative to Elasticsearch. If you want to migrate from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch, you can use the dedicated migration guide.
