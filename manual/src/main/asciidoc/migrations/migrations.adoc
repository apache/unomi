=== Important changes in public servlets since version 1.5.5 and 2.0.0
What used to be dedicated servlets are now part of the REST endpoints.
Prior to version 1.5.5 the following servlets were used:

* /context.js /context.json
* /eventcollector
* /client

In version 2.0.0 and 1.5.5 and later you have to use the new `cxs` REST endpoints:

* /cxs/context.js /cxs/context.json
* /cxs/eventcollector
* /cxs/client

The old servlets have been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version, so make sure
to update your client applications.
