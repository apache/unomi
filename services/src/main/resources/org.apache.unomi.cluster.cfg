# The nodeStatisticsUpdateFrequency controls the frequency of the update of system statistics such as CPU load,
# system load average and uptime. This value is set in milliseconds and is set to 10 seconds by default. Each node
# will retrieve the local values and broadcast them through a cluster event to all the other nodes to update
# the global cluster statistics.
